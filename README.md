# Code-of-Conduct

This policy is designed to maintain a strictly technical focus while actively discouraging the types of social and political discussions that sometimes occur in open source communities.

It is a notably direct and minimalist code of conduct policy that takes a distinctly different approach from many standard open source project policies.

Here are the key aspects:

## Core Philosophy

* Focuses exclusively on software-related contributions
* Explicitly rejects discussion of personal characteristics or identity unless directly relevant to software (e.g., accessibility issues)
* Takes a "software-only" stance on what's acceptable to discuss

## Key Points

* Standards are simple: If it relates to the software, it's allowed. If it doesn't, it isn't.
* Explicitly rejects "performative virtue signalling" and identity-based conflicts
* Expects participants to "behave like sensible adults" without detailed behavioral guidelines

## Governance

* Single decision maker (repo owner) with complete authority
* No debate or discussion of moderation decisions
* Clear enforcement email provided
* Violations handled based on severity and frequency

## Scope

* Applies only within code repositories
* Makes no claims on behavior outside the project space

## What makes this policy unusual

* Rejects the common practice of detailed behavioral guidelines
* Takes an explicitly anti-political stance
* Deliberately minimalist approach to rules and enforcement
* Adapts the Contributor Covenant template but significantly modifies its typical approach
* Focuses solely on technical merit and software-related contributions
