# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as authors and contributors pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of who you are or what you think. That means age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation confer no special privileges or preferences in how you are treated and can behave toward others. In fact, we have no interest in you sharing _any_ personal characteristics unless it is directly relevant to the software (e.g. an accessibility issue).

All we care about is the software.

## Our Standards

Anything that doesn't directly relate to the software has no purpose being posted, so making any kind of list of acceptable or unacceptable behavior is rather pointless. If it relates to the software, it is allowed, otherwise it isn't.

We expect everyone to behave like a sensible adult.

We will not pander to performative virtue signalling especially when it is designed to target other users because you disagree with their opinions for any reason.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

As the repo owner, I am solely responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that I deem inappropriate.

I have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and may communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate but will not enter into any debate about any decisions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all repositories. Do whatever you want on your own time and your own platform.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to me for enforcement at simon@captaincodeman.com. Any legitimate complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly before any action is taken, all others will be ignored.

How violations are handled will depend entirely on the severity and frequency of the occurrences.
